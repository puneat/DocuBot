       "'Hopes of a nascent price recovery in the oil markets went up in smoke yesterday. Brent and WTI snapped a two-day run of gains as US banking jitters resurfaced. Shares in First Republic plunged by 50% and in doing so reignited fears over the health of the banking sector. The sharp drop came a day after the embattled US regional bank revealed that customers had withdrawn $100 billion during the first-quarter crisis. Yesterday’s rout on Wall Street suggests that the banking crisis may still have another sting in its tail.\\r\\n\\nAlongside renewed banking fears, risk appetite was undermined by mixed earnings reports and yet more downbeat US macro data. The Conference Board’s survey of consumer confidence fell to a nine-month low in April. This will add credence to claims that the US economy is edging closer to a recession. Meanwhile, investors’ negative mindset concerning the health of the world’s biggest economy lent support to the safe-haven dollar. The US currency added 0.5% against a basket of its major peers.\\r\\n\\nSince the current downtrend began on the 13th of April, open interest in ICE Brent has increased by 63 million bbls. This suggests that speculative shorts are returning to the market. Nevertheless, oil bulls are waiting in the wings ahead of a price-supportive drawdown in global oil stocks. This phenomenon is already playing out in the US. Commercial crude oil stocks are trending lower and fell again last week by a forecasting-beating 6.1 million bbls, data from the API showed. Products were a mixed affair with gasoline stockpiles declining by 1.9 million bbls and distillate fuel inventories rising by 1.7 million bbls.\\r\\n\\nWe love a good correlation here at London’s premier oil brokerage. The trouble is they have been out of kilter of late. The previously very direct correlation between China’s economic growth and oil prices was missing last week. Chinese oil demand is starting to tick up but has failed to spur a surge in oil prices. Latest data released from China showed March crude imports at their second-highest level on record at 12.3 mbpd, while domestic refineries ran an all-time high 14.9 mbpd. A further bounce in consumption is on the cards during the upcoming Golden Week holiday in early May. The initial omens are encouraging although there is no guarantee this will act as a boon for oil prices.\\r\\n\\nMeanwhile, the long-standing inverse relationship between the oil price and the US dollar is also missing. A strong dollar drives up importing countries’ costs in local currencies, depressing demand and vice versa. Even accounting for yesterday’s rebound, the dollar index has been trending lower so far this month yet is failing to translate into a bullish catalyst for oil prices.\\r\\n\\nSo, why are these oil correlations out of sync? Better said, what is preventing the oil market from rallying? Hints of recession later this year from the Federal Reserve is feeding into market sentiment. These concerns are made worse by fears that looming interest rate hikes by central banks in the US, UK and EU could dampen economic growth and energy demand.\\r\\n\\nMost recently, growing fears of disappointing demand have been compounded by downbeat US gasoline consumption levels. Demand for the fuel is underwhelming ahead of the start of the summer driving season. Gasoline delivered fell by 4.6% in the week to April 21 compared to the previous week, according to the EIA. What’s more, volumes are about 4% lower year-on-year, which in itself was a low baseline.\\r\\n\\nOn the supply front, prices have also been kept down by resilient crude shipments out of Russia. Russian four-week average exports of crude oil to Asia jumped to a record-high of 3.28 mbpd in the four weeks to April 21, vessel-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg showed on Monday. Total crude oil exports continued to average a high of 3.4 mbpd during the same period, despite the 500,000 bpd production cut Moscow claims to be implementing until the end of this year.\\r\\n\\nHowever, looking beyond strong Russian crude shipments and macroeconomic pessimism there has been no dramatic change to bullish near-term oil fundamentals. From next month, fresh OPEC cuts mean that oil markets will be noticeably undersupplied. At the same time, the onset of the peak consumption season should provide a fillip for the demand side of the oil equation. Simply put, the stage is set for a substantial supply deficit in the second half of 2023. Signals pointing to a tightening market can already be observed in the prompt market structure to physical and futures markets. And soon enough, previously mentioned oil correlations will also be pointing in the same direction.\\r\\n\\nInternet connections are not secure and therefore we do not communicate formally by email and do not accept legal responsibility for the contents of this message.

At the core of the current bout of price malaise are concerns that rising interest could hit economic growth. The Fed, BoE and ECB are all expected to hike rates next month as they continue to battle stubbornly high inflation. In the meantime, downbeat US economic data released on Thursday stoked fears of a looming recession in the world’s biggest economy. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment support rose last week by slightly more than expected. Shortly after, figures revealed that existing home sales fell in March as rising borrowing costs kept buyers on the sidelines. Meanwhile, a survey from the Philadelphia Fed Reserve showed its measure of factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region plunged to the lowest level in nearly three years in April. Economic and interest rate uncertainty is front-and-centre of the oil market’s focus. Nevertheless, near and medium-term oil fundamentals remain supportive.
