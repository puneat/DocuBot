17-Jul-2023 17:53:10,Puneet Mishra <puneet.mishra@hertshtengroup.com>,Fw: PVM Fundamental Report April 26 2023,"Hopes of a nascent price recovery in the oil markets went up in smoke yesterday. Brent and WTI snapped a two-day run of gains as US banking jitters resurfaced. Shares in First Republic plunged by 50% and in doing so reignited fears over the health of the banking sector. The sharp drop came a day after the embattled US regional bank revealed that customers had withdrawn $100 billion during the first-quarter crisis. Yesterday’s rout on Wall Street suggests that the banking crisis may still have another sting in its tail.

Alongside renewed banking fears, risk appetite was undermined by mixed earnings reports and yet more downbeat US macro data. The Conference Board’s survey of consumer confidence fell to a nine-month low in April. This will add credence to claims that the US economy is edging closer to a recession. Meanwhile, investors’ negative mindset concerning the health of the world’s biggest economy lent support to the safe-haven dollar. The US currency added 0.5% against a basket of its major peers.

Since the current downtrend began on the 13th of April, open interest in ICE Brent has increased by 63 million bbls. This suggests that speculative shorts are returning to the market. Nevertheless, oil bulls are waiting in the wings ahead of a price-supportive drawdown in global oil stocks. This phenomenon is already playing out in the US. Commercial crude oil stocks are trending lower and fell again last week by a forecasting-beating 6.1 million bbls, data from the API showed. Products were a mixed affair with gasoline stockpiles declining by 1.9 million bbls and distillate fuel inventories rising by 1.7 million bbls.

We love a good correlation here at London’s premier oil brokerage. The trouble is they have been out of kilter of late. The previously very direct correlation between China’s economic growth and oil prices was missing last week. Chinese oil demand is starting to tick up but has failed to spur a surge in oil prices. Latest data released from China showed March crude imports at their second-highest level on record at 12.3 mbpd, while domestic refineries ran an all-time high 14.9 mbpd. A further bounce in consumption is on the cards during the upcoming Golden Week holiday in early May. The initial omens are encouraging although there is no guarantee this will act as a boon for oil prices.

Meanwhile, the long-standing inverse relationship between the oil price and the US dollar is also missing. A strong dollar drives up importing countries’ costs in local currencies, depressing demand and vice versa. Even accounting for yesterday’s rebound, the dollar index has been trending lower so far this month yet is failing to translate into a bullish catalyst for oil prices.

So, why are these oil correlations out of sync? Better said, what is preventing the oil market from rallying? Hints of recession later this year from the Federal Reserve is feeding into market sentiment. These concerns are made worse by fears that looming interest rate hikes by central banks in the US, UK and EU could dampen economic growth and energy demand.

Most recently, growing fears of disappointing demand have been compounded by downbeat US gasoline consumption levels. Demand for the fuel is underwhelming ahead of the start of the summer driving season. Gasoline delivered fell by 4.6% in the week to April 21 compared to the previous week, according to the EIA. What’s more, volumes are about 4% lower year-on-year, which in itself was a low baseline.

On the supply front, prices have also been kept down by resilient crude shipments out of Russia. Russian four-week average exports of crude oil to Asia jumped to a record-high of 3.28 mbpd in the four weeks to April 21, vessel-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg showed on Monday. Total crude oil exports continued to average a high of 3.4 mbpd during the same period, despite the 500,000 bpd production cut Moscow claims to be implementing until the end of this year.

However, looking beyond strong Russian crude shipments and macroeconomic pessimism there has been no dramatic change to bullish near-term oil fundamentals. From next month, fresh OPEC cuts mean that oil markets will be noticeably undersupplied. At the same time, the onset of the peak consumption season should provide a fillip for the demand side of the oil equation. Simply put, the stage is set for a substantial supply deficit in the second half of 2023. Signals pointing to a tightening market can already be observed in the prompt market structure to physical and futures markets. And soon enough, previously mentioned oil correlations will also be pointing in the same direction.

17-Jul-2023 17:53:02,Puneet Mishra <puneet.mishra@hertshtengroup.com>,Fw: PVM Fundamental Report April 25 2023,"OPEC has been vindicated and its critics have been left red-faced on the past two occasions – at least for now. At the beginning of October last year, the producer group announced a reduction of 2 mbpd in the combined output ceiling citing uncertainty surrounding the global economy in general and the oil market in particular. Brent jumped from $90/bbl to $98/bbl in the space of a week before drifting lower. Another 1.66 mbpd was then added to this cut at the beginning of this month as “a precautionary measure aimed at supporting the stability of the oil market”. Prices advanced almost $8/bbl. Calls for $100+ Brent grew louder, nonetheless the enthusiasm has evaporated rather quickly, and oil retreated from the peak reached a fortnight ago. In fact, one might argue that the action of the alliance resulted in an equilibrium and ensured that oil prices remain in a $20/bbl range, $70/bbl being the lower end and $90/bbl the top end, basis Brent. Some kind of stability has been provided. On a side note, it is worth pointing out that the new combined output ceiling of 40.19 mbpd excluding Iran, Libya and Venezuela would still be higher than the group’s collective March production level of 39.63 mbpd (IEA data).

The lowering of the OPEC+ output quotas by 3.66 mbpd helped the market find a bottom but failed to provide the perceived support that could take the price of oil considerably over the $90/bbl mark. One of the two reasons for this wariness and lack of upside potential is macroeconomic considerations – whether justified or not. A set of disheartening economic data coupled with the recent mini crisis in the banking sector in March, sluggish earnings reports and the widely expected continuous rise in borrowing costs in the world’s major economies has ostensibly dented investors’ sentiment. Global and regional growth projections have been revised down. What is intriguing to observe is that the slowing of economic expansion would have been a welcome development not so long ago. Bad news used to be good news. After all, the ultimate purpose of interest rate hikes is to cool economic growth without triggering fears of recession. The voices of those predicting contraction are getting stronger, albeit it has to be emphasized that the performance of the equity and bond markets and the relative weakness of the dollar does not paint an unambiguously bleak picture. The MSCI All-country equity index has suffered from a wave of fresh selling in the last few days, but it is more than 8% higher than last month. The 10-year US bond yield, albeit has risen from 3.3% to 3.5% this month, sits comfortably below the 4.1% peak at the beginning of March. And finally, the dollar index, which flirted with the 100 milestone two weeks ago, failed to break below it, yet it is nowhere near this year’s summit of 106 achieved in March. Financial markets do not seem to be expecting inflation running amok leading to relentless rate hikes.

Optimism, on the other hand, is missing from the oil market. After reaching a peak of $87.49/bbl two weeks ago sellers emerged and pushed prices towards the pre-OPEC+ decision gap. The loss of confidence was, to a great extent, the result of resilient Russian oil exports, as described in yesterday’s note. Although Russian crude oil exports to China and India remain elevated (the imports of Russian crude oil of the world’s most populous country pushed OPEC’s share of the Indian market to a 22-year low, and China’s loading of Urals reached its highest in 11 months, according to Reuters) it is the middle distillates that are preventing the market from breaking significantly higher. The widely anticipated gasoil and distillate shortage that was supposed to take place after the introduction of the G7 embargo on February 5 has never materialized. It looks as though that European gasoil stocks have been successfully replenished in the past few months (they are more than 50% above last year’s level, PJK International data suggests) greatly aided by a milder-than-average winter. Consequently, the expected US distillate exports into Europe has never occurred. No wonder then that both the CME and ICE distillate/crude oil crack spreads have weakened meaningfully, and the steep backwardation of the Heating Oil and Gasoil contracts seen at the beginning of the year has been narrowing perennially and could actually turn into contango as the peak heating period draws to an end on the northern hemisphere.

The outlook, however, should brighten soon. Global oil demand, helped by the beginning of the US driving season and Chinese economic revival, will pick up and scale new peaks. OPEC+ production will remain subdued and could even deteriorate further, the sluggish dollar would continue support oil prices and unless ominous signs of recession are emerging the risk aversion will turn into risk appetite as the second half of the year approaches.

The way up will not be a walk in the park. The view on recession will ebb and flow and dips cannot be ruled out next months as the Fed, the ECB and the BoE are all anticipated to make lending more expensive. These immediate economic concerns, however, were swept under the carpet yesterday and a series of unrelated events pushed oil prices higher. The protracted stand-off between Iraq and the Kurdish Regional Government implies that the restart of oil exports from the northern part of the country is anything but imminent. In Texas production has been affected in three refineries with a combined capacity of almost 800,000 bpd because of adverse weather conditions, in Colombia an 85,000 bpd crude oil pipeline has been bombed and the deteriorating security situation in Sudan (production of around 70,000 bpd), which is on the brink of civil war must also make short sellers cautious. Attacking the upper end of the range will probably take time but, in the words of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, patience is bitter, but its fruit is sweet.

17-Jul-2023 17:52:57,Puneet Mishra <puneet.mishra@hertshtengroup.com>,Fw: PVM Fundamental Report April 24 2023,"Friday’s modest rebound couldn’t prevent the crude oil markets from snaping four consecutive weeks of gains. Brent and WTI posted weekly falls of more than 5% and in doing so reversed all their gains from the OPEC cuts. And the cause for the change in sentiment? Uncertainty over demand. Concerns that the global economy is slowing down and that oil demand will consequently take a hit are at the forefront of investors’ minds.

Indeed, it was a mixed week on the macro front. Latest data from China suggested robust demand as GDP growth for the first quarter beat expectations. Elsewhere, economic updates implied that the world’s biggest economy is slowing down. That being said, conflicting data on Friday showed US business activity rose to an 11-month high in April. Meanwhile, adding to the unease is the prospect of further monetary policy tightening. Stubbornly high inflation is underpinning heightened expectations of fresh rate hikes in the US, the UK, and the eurozone early next month. Rising interest rates are not conducive to economic growth nor improving oil demand.

Judging by last week’s price action, market players see oil demand shrinking. Nevertheless, the start of May will usher in the start of the annual peak consumption season. By most accounts, global oil demand will hit a record high this summer, which in turn should serve as a solid base for upward pricing pressures to return. Until then, however, economic uncertainty and interest rate jitters will keep upside potential in check.

Earlier this month, Russia’s energy minister boasted that it has succeeded in redirecting all exports that fell under the embargo. For once, the Kremlin was not talking complete gobbledygook. Russia’s oil exports have surpassed levels last seen before it invaded Ukraine, despite a barrage of Western sanctions. Russian weekly crude oil exports by sea have returned to above 3 mbpd. For the month of April, Urals crude loadings from Russia’s western ports are set to be more than 2.4 mbpd, the highest level since 2019, according to Reuters calculations.

China and India continue to underpin demand for nearly all of Russia's crude. Customs data released last week showed Chinese imports of Russian crude hit an all-time time high of 2.27 mbpd in March, ahead of the Saudi’s 2.1 mbpd. Yet it must be said that rising flows of Russian oil exports are at odds with several constraints. For starters, Russia is meant to be reducing output by 500,000 bpd. Heightened shipment levels have cast widespread scepticism over whether the pledged reduction ever took place.

At the same time, demand for Russian crude is increasing even as discounts against global benchmarks narrow. Smaller discounts for Urals against global benchmarks coupled with rising prices means that Russia's flagship crude grade Urals is now trading above the $60 price cap. Average discounts for Urals delivered to India ports on DAP terms are at $13/bbl to dated Brent, putting it at around $68/bbl. It must be noted that rising prices for Russian crude have been partly offset by lower freight rates. Shipping costs have come down significantly in recent weeks, suggesting that Russian oil suppliers have secured enough vessels to travel longer distances.

All the while, the collapse in product exports following the EU embargo on February 5 has not materialised. If anything, shipments are rising. Sea-borne diesel exports increased by 12% m-o-m in March. Russia is finding new markets for its fuel exports in Africa and Latin America.  Russian petroleum products are even turning up in the Middle East. Kpler estimates that Russia is now sending around 100,000 bpd of fuels to Saudi Arabia, compared to virtually zero before the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Against all the odds, Russia has found a home for nearly all its oil capacity. What’s more, the Kremlin is enjoying stronger revenues as India and China continue to snap up Russian oil even as prices climb above the Western price cap of $60/bbl. Flows may take a dip next month as Chinese refiners enter maintenance season, but thereafter it will be business as usual. Better said, there appears to be little standing in the way of Russia keeping exports at heightened levels over the coming months. Sensing that the sanctioned nation faring better than expected, the G7 is reportedly conspiring a complete ban on Russian exports. Russian may be losing on the battlefield, but it is winning the war in the energy markets.

17-Jul-2023 17:52:52,Puneet Mishra <puneet.mishra@hertshtengroup.com>,Fw: PVM Fundamental Report April 21 2023,"Oil markets were a sea of red yesterday. Brent and WTI shed around $2/bbl with the former coming perilously close to losing the $80/bbl handle. At the core of the current bout of price malaise are concerns that rising interest could hit economic growth. The Fed, BoE and ECB are all expected to hike rates next month as they continue to battle stubbornly high inflation.

In the meantime, downbeat US economic data released on Thursday stoked fears of a looming recession in the world’s biggest economy. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment support rose last week by slightly more than expected. Shortly after, figures revealed that existing home sales fell in March as rising borrowing costs kept buyers on the sidelines. Meanwhile, a survey from the Philadelphia Fed Reserve showed its measure of factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region plunged to the lowest level in nearly three years in April.

Economic and interest rate uncertainty is front-and-centre of the oil market’s focus. Nevertheless, near and medium-term oil fundamentals remain supportive. Global oil stocks are forecast to begin drawing from next month on the back of fresh OPEC cuts and accelerating Chinese demand. In view of this, the oil market should soon find a bottom and undergo an upward bounce.

Things are looking up for the US crude futures benchmark. WTI is in full-on catch-up mode with the international Brent futures contract. On a monthly basis, the ICE Brent/NYMEX WTI differential averaged $5.84/bbl in March, down from $6.68/bbl in February. As things stand, it is currently printing below $4/bbl. Meanwhile, in another positive development, the prompt-month timespread has flipped into backwardation.

This bout of relative structural and outright strengthening appears to have the legs to stick around for a while. This is down to supportive localised fundamentals. To begin with, although US fuel demand is still languishing below the year-ago level and five-year average, it is well positioned to make a comeback over the summer months. Latest US macro data points to buoyant service sector activity and robust employment levels. This is creating conditions that support fuel consumption. Indeed, the EIA now predicts that gasoline demand will return to growth on annual basis this year.

As mobility levels improve, refinery runs are set to ramp up. US refinery utilisation rates have scrambled above 90% for the first time this year, reaching 91% in the week to April 14. Processing volumes should rise further as spring conclusions end and ExxonMobil’s 250,000 bpd Beaumont expansion comes online. Rising crude throughputs will hasten the current drawdown in oil inventories. US crude stocks have been trending lower since the end of February and latest weekly data show they have fallen back below the 5-year average for the first time since early January. What’s more, stocks at Cushing are also drifting lower. Between the weeks of February 24 and April 14, stockpiles at the NYMEX delivery point fell by 20%.

Staying on the supply front, a further bullish element for the WTI complex is lacklustre domestic production. Crude oil output in the country has stagnated just above 12 mbpd since the start of the year. Moreover, US oil rigs are on the downswing. All this makes for downbeat growth prospects. In its latest monthly report, the EIA forecast a crude output exit rate of 12.6 mbpd for this year which is only 300,000 bpd more than current production levels. The flattening producing profile for the US crude patch spells good news for the WTI crude patch.

And then there is WTI’s trump card: strategic reserve refills. Last month, the US announced that it would not repurchase all the oil it has previously sold from the reserve this year. It added that refilling the SPR may take years. Then earlier this month, in an apparent U-turn, the Biden administration hinted it could start replenishing strategic reserves in the fourth quarter of 2023. These crude purchases amount to more than 200 million bbls and therefore represent a major source of future oil demand for WTI-linked crude. That being said, buy-backs will depend on prevailing prices. Washington has set a price band of $67-$72/bbl for the refilling phase. US crude prices are currently trading at $77/bbl, and given the supportive fundamentals pencilled in for 2H23, it could be a while yet before SPR fills gets the green light. Even so, the combination of rising domestic refinery runs, tightening crude supplies and sustained exports should keep WTI close to Brent’s tail.

17-Jul-2023 17:52:47,Puneet Mishra <puneet.mishra@hertshtengroup.com>,Fw: PVM Fundamental Report April 20 2023,"After four straight weekly advances, the oil complex is in a full-blown correction. The two leading crude futures benchmarks lost further value yesterday and in doing so gave up all their gains from the latest OPEC+ cuts. At the heart of the market’s newfound malaise are expectations of growth-sapping interest rate rises on both sides of the Atlantic. On Wednesday, US Federal Reserve policymakers reiterated their commitment to reigning in inflation in yet another strong signal that it will hike borrowing costs next month. Meanwhile, investors are anticipating a further rate rise from the Bank of England and European Central Bank after data showed inflation remained at harmful levels last month.

Away from interest rate jitters, inventory data from the EIA revealed that US crude stocks fell last week by a bigger-than-expected 4.6 million bbls. This decline took domestic crude stockpiles back below the 5-year norm for the first time since the opening week of 2023. Spearheading this pullback was a strong rebound in US crude exports and an uptick in refinery runs as spring turnarounds came to an end. On a less positive note, gasoline stocks unexpectedly increased by 1.3 million bbls following a decline in demand. Distillate fuel stockpiles were more or less unchanged on the week.

A fresh wave of selling is sending the energy complex lower this morning. As things stand, the oil market is caught in a negative thought loop with bears in the driving seat. That being said, the outlook for oil fundamentals remains supportive. Oil balances are becoming incrementally bullish, which in turn should limit the downside for prices.

These are unpredictable times for the global macroeconomic outlook. Downside risks are mounting amid rising interest rates, elevated core inflation levels and increasing debt burdens. Yet, one less talked about red flag that is also casting a shadow on growth prospects is the divergence between robust service sector activity and declining manufacturing production.

Purchasing managers’ indices (PMI) from March highlight the continuing deceleration in manufacturing and the improvements in the services sectors of the world’s three biggest economies. Service sector activity across the US, eurozone and China is buoyant whereas manufacturing remains a sore point. The US March ISM manufacturing PMI decelerated to stand at 46.3, after reaching 47.7 in February, as it remained below the growth-indicating level of 50 for the fifth consecutive month. Meanwhile, the S&P Global Eurozone Manufacturing PMI remained in contractionary territory, standing at 47.3 in March, compared with 48.5 in February and 48.8 in January. In China, the Caixin manufacturing PMI unexpectedly fell to 50.0 in March 2022 after expanding in February for the first time in seven months.

The diverging trends in service and manufacturing sectors are not only putting the brakes on the global economic outlook but are also having a strong bearing on product demand. Gasoil demand is typically closely aligned with industrial activity. The distillate fuel is an important input for industrial users hence why its demand outlook is typically closely associated with prospects for manufacturers. Conversely, gasoline follows employment levels and activity in the services sector.

Given that growth is predominately being driven by the service sector with manufacturing activity in the doldrums, retail-orientated gasoline is outperforming the more industrial-linked gasoil. The seasonality of fuel product demand favours gasoline a present but the service-sector-led growth of the global economy is providing a further tailwind for the road fuel. Accordingly, the price gap between gasoline and diesel is widening by more than usual for this time of the year.  Front-month NYMEX RBOB gasoline is currently trading around 9 cts/gal above the NYMEX ULSD contract, compared to a five-year average of -15 cts/gal.

Unsurprisingly, gasoline cracks are trending higher while gasoil cracks are easing. The RBOB versus WTI front-month crack is currently trading near a seasonal all-time high of around $32/bbl. What’s more, this compares favourably to the 2018-2022 average of $22/bbl. In contrast, the ULSD/WTI crack spread is currently printing $28/bbl, down from $40/bbl this time last month. The same pattern is observed in Europe. The ICE LSGasoil/Brent is trading near a 14-month low of $16/bbl having averaged $27/bbl in March.

This trend is expected to continue over the coming months. Indeed, gasoline consumption will be spurred by the summer driving season whereas sluggish manufacturing activity will continue to depress industrial fuel demand for the rest of the year. Echoing this sentiment are the latest projections from the EIA. For the year as a whole, the US energy agency forecasts domestic gasoline demand will rise by 80,000 bpd from last year. In contrast, distillate fuel oil consumption is expected to shrink by 70,000 bpd. Meanwhile, financial speculators are bolstering their bets on rising gasoline prices at the expense of diesel. Latest data from the CFTC showed the ratio of long to short NYMEX RBOB gasoline future holding reached 5.9 compared to 2.4 on NYMEX ULSD. Better said, diesel may have been the star performer of the oil complex in 2022 but don’t expect a repeat performance this year.

17-Jul-2023 17:52:41,Puneet Mishra <puneet.mishra@hertshtengroup.com>,Fw: PVM Fundamental Report April 19 2023,"Upbeat data out of China usually provides a boon for oil prices. Not on this occasion. Figures released yesterday pointing to an accelerating Chinese economy failed to provide a launchpad for energy prices to rally. China’s economy grew by a faster-than-expected 4.5% in the first quarter while oil refinery throughput rose to record levels in March. Yet bullish cheer was in short supply as China’s demand recovery was eclipsed by economic concerns. Latest macro updates revealed that investor sentiment in the eurozone’s biggest economy unexpectedly fell this month while the US housing sector cooled in March.

Staying in the US, rate jitters added a further layer of unease for those of a bullish disposition. The respective Presidents from the St Louis and Atlanta Federal Reserve hinted that interest rates should be raised further in order to combat persistent inflation. Needless to say, such hawkish comments reinforced market expectations for a Fed rate hike in early May. This, in turn, will exacerbate concerns that further policy tightening will lead to a demand-sapping recession.

Market players are now shifting their focus to the state of US oil inventories. Overnight, the API reported a bigger-than-expected 2.68 million bbl draw in crude stocks. Gasoline inventories fell by 1.02 million bbls while distillate fuel stockpiles declined by 1.9 million bbls. Even so, this price-supportive data is failing to spur any fresh buying. And therein lies the major challenge currently facing oil bulls. Bullish catalysts are mounting for oil markets but are having a muted impact on sentiment. This oddity, however, can only continue for so long. Expect prices to resume their upward trend sooner rather than later.

On the surface, the US oil patch appears to be ticking along nicely. Comprehensive monthly EIA data revealed US crude oil production rebounded in January to a post-pandemic high of 12.46 mbpd. All the while, latest weekly EIA estimates showed US crude supply returned to an annual high of 12.3 mbpd in the week ended April 7. No surprise, then, that the EIA and IEA both upgrade their US crude supply estimates for this year in their latest monthly reports.

Yet, even though US crude oil production has recently hit its highest level since the pandemic, the growth rate has markedly slowed as the shale patch struggles. According to the latest EIA drilling report, tight oil output in the US is forecast to reach a record 9.32 mbpd in May, up only 50,000 bpd over the prior month. To put this in context, during the first four months of 2023, the average monthly increase in shale output was 132,000 bpd. What’s more, output in the biggest and most prolific shale basin, the Permian, is set to rise by about 33,000 bpd which would be the smallest gain since December 2016. Projections from the EIA also suggest that productivity is stalling. New-well oil production is forecast to be unchanged in May from this month.

Labour shortages, supply chain delays and the high cost of supplies are combining to put the brakes on drilling activity. Latest data from Baker Hughes showed US energy firms cut the number of oil rigs operating for a third week in a row. The number of rigs dedicated to crude dipped by 2 to 588, which was down from 623 in mid-January. The pullback in drilling is the legacy of the fall in prices seen at the tail end of the year. And looking ahead, there doesn’t seem to be much of an appetite from producers to ramp up drilling for fear of stoking service-cost inflation. In short, there is a good chance that US drilling has reached a zenith.

The lull in new drilling is also evidenced in the change in drilled by uncompleted wells. According to EIA drilling data, these so-called DUCs extended their decline last month, falling to the lowest in 9 years. Further underscoring the sector’s woes in the latest Dallas Fed Energy survey. The quarterly survey indicated that the availability of oilfield services remains tight, even as other supply chain pressures are easing. Furthermore, energy executives reported a steep slowdown in US oil and gas activity as firms faced increasing costs, so much so that it suggested the industry is near stagnation.

This trend of stagnant growth looks set to continue through this year, and beyond. The EIA’s year-end production forecast is only slightly above current output levels. Moreover, its 2024 domestic production forecast remains below the all-time established in late 2019. Barring a sustained WTI price above $100/bbl, growth in US crude supply will continue to crawl before reaching a plateau.

17-Jul-2023 17:52:35,Puneet Mishra <puneet.mishra@hertshtengroup.com>,Fw: PVM Fundamental Report April 18 2023,"Oil bulls were in retreat mode yesterday as a recovering dollar exerted downside pressure on the black gold. The US currency was bid higher against a basket of its major peers after upbeat macro updates bolstered expectations the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in May. Top of the bill was a survey showing activity at factories across New York state unexpectedly expanded this month for the first time in five months. Meanwhile, staying in the US, a drilling report from the EIA revealed that US shale output is set to rise 49,000 bpd next month to a fresh record high.

Elsewhere, murmurs that crude oil exports from the Kurdistan region via the Turkish port of Ceyhan could resume within days added to the risk-off tone. Last week, Iraq’s federal government and the Kurdistan Regional Government reached an initial agreement to restart northern oil exports. However, the resumption of flows still needs approval from Turkey. Until then, around 450,000 bpd in Iraqi oil exports remain offline.

Meanwhile, buying pressures were also undermined by the newfound rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The latter officially invited the former’s king to visit the country. The normalisation between the regional rivals needs careful motoring as it could potentially lead to additional flows from the sanctioned OPEC country.

As of this morning, oil markets are regaining some ground as traders cheer the release of forecast-beating Chinese GDP data. Figures released overnight showed China’s economy grew 4.5% year-on-year in the first quarter which eclipsed expectations of 4%. Separate data revealed that the country’s crude throughputs surged to record levels last month. Needless to say, this is all very positive for the demand picture. As things stand, it’s all systems go in China, much to the relief of those betting on higher oil prices.

Well, that didn’t last long. The OPEC-induced price euphoria seen at the start of the month is well and truly over. Oil prices have been largely range-bound since the OPEC+ announcement. Brent futures have traded in a range of $4/bbl while the average daily price range is down $1/bbl so far this month compared to March.

Buying has dried up as markets digest updates about the global economy and oil balance. Warnings about the economic outlook have come thick and fast of late. Last week, the IMF downgraded its world growth estimate for this year and hinted at a hard landing in developed economies. Shortly after, OPEC added to the recessionary alarmism by stressing the many challenges facing the global economy including rising interest rates and elevated inflation. Meanwhile, the IEA surmised that the latest OPEC+ cuts risk exacerbating the looming supply deficit and pushing both crude and product prices higher at a time of heightened economic fragility. Better said, OPEC’s latest cuts may have greenlighted a return to demand destruction territory.

Against this backdrop of macro and demand uncertainty, the lack of follow-through buying is understandable. The lull in pricing pressures is further emphasised by the latest data on financial players’ holdings of crude oil futures. Money managers sold the equivalent of 420,000 bbls in ICE Brent futures contracts in the week to April 11, the smallest weekly change in net speculative length since December 2021. This marks a sharp reversal from the previous week when the surprise OPEC+ production cut triggered the biggest buying spree of crude oil futures since 2016. Money managers hiked their bets on rising ICE Brent crude prices by a whopping 73 million bbls in the week to April 4, ICE data showed. As things stand, the massive, short covering and a renewed buying spree have given way to a wait-and-see attitude.

As is the norm, the lull in speculative re-positioning has dampened trading activity levels. In the week following the OPEC shock, average daily volumes (ADV) on ICE Brent stood at 1.23 million bbls. A week later ICE Brent ADV dipped to 932 million bbls. So far in April, ICE Brent ADV has averaged 930 million which puts it on track to register the lowest monthly ADV this year.

Despite the lull in bullish momentum on display within the speculative community, they remain overwhelmingly bullish. The ratio of long to short crude futures holdings by money managers stands at 7:1. And this should not come as a surprise. After all, the oil price outlook remains bright. Alongside OPEC+ cuts, China’s demand recovery is finally starting to come good. Chinese crude imports surged by 22.5% year-on-year in March to the highest monthly volumes in nearly three years. The supportive oil fundamentals are reflected by the Brent forward curve which is nicely in backwardation. This suggests that the lack of upside potential could yet be a short-term one. Odds are that oil prices will soon resume their upward trajectory, and when they do, expect bullish speculative positions and trading volumes to follow suit.

17-Jul-2023 17:52:30,Puneet Mishra <puneet.mishra@hertshtengroup.com>,Fw: PVM Fundamental Report April 17 2023,"The markets are in limbo and understandably so. On one hand, the latest leg up that was triggered by the unforeseen OPEC+ decision two weeks ago to increase the production cut from 2 mbpd to 3.66 mbpd has not reversed. On the other hand, the market has failed to significantly build on this undeniably price supportive development, it has been seesawing and for a good reason. This reason is uncertainty. Perceive tight oil balance is one thing, potential economic hardship is quite another. The current snapshot that is based on the updated reports from OPEC and the IEA suggests a substantial supply deficit in the second half of the year. It would justify considerably higher numbers. Yet, potential buyers seemed reluctant to swing into decisive action last week. Clearly, worries about stuttering economic growth and untameable inflation are capping efforts to push prices higher. There are even talks of recession as a worst-case scenario. And it is irrelevant if current available data does not confirm this pessimism. There is a financial diarrhoea doing the rounds, which prevents risk appetite to grow healthily. To put it in a different way, the action of those who are driven by current data is countered by future wariness. Additionally, market actors interpret forecasts according to their tastes. The above-mentioned monthly data from OPEC and the IEA is a fitting example of this attitude.

OPEC, the coalition of oil producers that have been under constant fire from the biggest oil consumer of the world for reducing output, warned in its latest MOMR Feature Article of the potential challenges to economic growth that comes in the form of high inflation, monetary tightening, uncertainty surrounding financial stability and unambiguously high debt levels. The lukewarm impact of China’s re-opening could also pose risk to demand growth, OPEC believes. Yet, what we find is an awfully tight second half of the year with the demand for the organization’s oil forecast to be at 30 mbpd. The group’s production, accounting for the roughly 1 mbpd cut announced two weeks ago, ought to be below 29 mbpd (we are going with 28.9 mbpd but it could be a few hundred thousand barrels below that). The simple maths then indicates that global oil inventories will deplete at a rate of 1.09 mbpd.

The IEA, the energy watchdog of the developed world, on the other hand, focussed on the potential impact of the decision from the producer alliance to accelerate output cuts. It emphasized the aggravating deficit in oil supply and the danger of boosting oil prices in the latter half of 2023 when the economic backdrop is anything but certain. When amending the supply side of the oil equation to reflect the production cut the IEA’s estimate is even more jaw-dropping than the one OPEC produced. The call will stand at 30.3 mbpd during the July-December period of the year and whilst it is a downward adjustment of 500,000 bpd from March, this revision is much less than the planned OPEC cut. Consequently, the drawdown in global oil inventories will be 1.4 mbpd. Assuming that 40% of it will take place in the rich part of the world OECD stocks are to decline to 2.747 billion bbls in 3Q and to 2.695 billion bbls in 4Q. To put the latter figures into perspective, the 3Q estimate is the same as in the corresponding period of 2022 whilst 4Q inventories would be 82 million bbls lower than at the end of yesteryear. These projections imply an average Brent price of around $95/bbl for 2H 2023.

The two diverging schools of thought are also tangible in the financial markets. Numbers are bullish, and negative data must be viewed as encouraging. Inflation is high but it is coming lower. Last week saw the release of the US CPI and PPI figures from March. Elevated price levels are still a concern, but the trend is undeniably getting friendly – the price rise is decelerating. Retail sales, manufacturing data and import prices fell in March. New applications for unemployment benefit have risen more than expected, a sign of slowing labour market – one of the chief worries of the Fed. Whether it means that the US central bank follows in the footsteps of Australia, Canada and Singapore and pauses the hike in borrowing costs remains to be seen, nonetheless the key take away is that the monetary tightening seems to be working – the economy is cooling but still growing. Yet, the IMF was at pains to alert to the danger of hard landing and the spill over of the US banking crisis. Ostensibly, there is a fine line between healthy economic and oil demand growth and the elevated risk of entrenched inflation and even recession. Which side of this line one is on depends on one’s unbiased view of the impact of monetary tightening, which is admittedly a daunting task.

The performance in the financial oil markets hints at tentative optimism. The MSCI All-Country index gained 1.32% on the week. Risk was back on fashion popular, consequently the dollar softened against six of its major peers. The index lost 4.5% of its value since the beginning of March. Not only does the weakness in the greenback support oil but, especially if protracted, provides immeasurable relief for developing nations to service their dollar denominated debts contributing to global economic growth.

Tepid weekly gains in the five major oil futures contracts neatly reflect the concerns about economic headwinds, nonetheless the fact that the general structure is solid backwardation is promising. The path higher is not conspicuous at the moment, however. Like any good broker, we are offering a view that might please both camps: those who believe that inflation is chronic rather than acute and will have negative consequences for growth and for those who are turning increasingly buoyant, simply due to the expected widening of the supply gap. Pragmatism and caution are probably justified currently, and the upside can be limited. However, at the first signs of genuine and actual tightness and stock depletion, which could come from the implementation of OPEC+ cut from next month, further improvement in inflationary outlook or the combination of the two, a break above $90/bbl will be fully anticipated and a rally towards $100/bbl could not be ruled out later in the 2023.

And a prolonged break over $100/bbl? There is precedent for it. From 2011 to 2014 Brent was happy in an established range of $31/bbl, between $97/bbl and $128/bbl. Credit and thus life, was, however, much cheaper back then. It is, therefore, inconceivable that a pop into the $100+ territory could be maintained for a lengthened period of time until inflation falls to its declared target and borrowing becomes affordable again.

17-Jul-2023 17:52:25,Puneet Mishra <puneet.mishra@hertshtengroup.com>,Fw: PVM Fundamental Report April 14 2023,"Recessionary alarmism is back in the headlines. Earlier this week, the IMF downgraded its growth outlook for this year and the next as it warned of a hard landing in major economies amid high interest rates and elevated core inflation. Shortly after, minutes from the March meeting of the Federal Reserve showed policymakers believe America’s economy will tilt into recession later this year. The challenging outlook was subsequently echoed in OPEC’s latest monthly report, which was released yesterday. The organisation flagged the usual macro headwinds including high inflation and monetary tightening. Yet despite these casting a shadow on the demand side of the oil equation, OPEC held steady on its demand forecasts.

The projection for 2023 world oil demand growth was left unchanged at 2.3 mbpd to average 101.9 mbpd. What’s more, the forecast for China’s oil consumption growth was increased by 50,000 bpd to 760,000 bpd. The country’s oil demand is set to see y-o-y growth of 1 mbpd this quarter and 800,000 bpd in 3Q23. In short, OPEC is still bullish on China and the broader oil demand outlook. This begs the question of why the cartel announced a surprise cut in production earlier this month. The initial consensus is that it was a pre-emptive move to counter a potential pullback in demand. However, it is impossible to reconcile this narrative with OPEC’s upbeat demand projections. The only conclusion is that the rationale for slashing supply was the pursuit of higher oil prices, pure and simple.

OPEC’s copy’n’paste approach to its demand projections was mirrored on the supply front. Non-OPEC liquids supply growth remained broadly unchanged from last month and is forecast to grow by 1.4 mbpd this year. That being said, the quarterly view tells a different story. The 1Q figure was upped due to higher-than-expected US oil flows. Meanwhile, the outlook for the second half of the year was trimmed by 300,000 bpd to reflect the recent decision by Russia to extend production cuts until the end of the year.

Staying on the supply front, OPEC crude production fell by 86,000 bpd in March to 28.8 mbpd. Within the group, Nigeria’s revival which began at the end of last year appears to have run out of steam. The WAF producer recorded its first crude oil production decline in six months. Production has stabilised at just under 1.4 mbpd, despite the country setting its sights on reaching an output level of 1.6 mbpd by the first quarter of 2023.

Looking ahead, OPEC production is set fall further following the announcement of fresh cuts. Supply is poised to plunge by nearly 1 mbpd from next month, taking the group’s supply down towards the 28 mbpd threshold. At the same time, OPEC expects demand for its crude in the second half of this year to be higher than expected. It sees that call on its crude averaging 30 mbpd in 2H23, 190,000 bpd more than last month’s estimate. In other words, the oil market is barrelling towards a supply deficit. Global oil stocks have built on a quarterly basis since 2Q22 but the stage is now set for hefty inventory draws, much to the delight of oil bulls.

At long last, the moment that oil markets have been waiting for is upon us. Hard data pointing to a strong rebound in Chinese oil buying has finally landed. Customs data released yesterday showed China’s crude imports recovered from the decline in January-February. The country’s purchases of foreign crude surged by 22.5% in March from the same month in 2022 to 12.3 mbpd, the second-highest reading on record. This suggests that China’s return to normalcy is on track and reinforces expectations that it will be the single biggest oil demand driver over the coming months.

Elsewhere, there was encouraging macro data out of America, namely further evidence that inflationary pressures are easing. A day after a consumer price report showed inflation cooling by more-than-expected last month, the latest PPI data revealed producer prices unexpectedly fell in March. The producer price index for final demand declined by 0.5% in March from the previous month. On an annual basis, the PPI increased by 2.7%, the smallest year-on-year rise since January 2021 and followed a 4.9% advance in February.

Yet it’s not all good news. The improving picture for US inflation spells bad news for the US dollar. Indeed, the US currency traded near a one-year low yesterday against a basket of its major peers amid expectations that the Fed is nearing the end of its rate hike cycle. However, the troubled greenback was lost on oil prices. Brent and WTI ended the session around $1/bbl as traders locked in profits and fretted about the demand outlook. Further clarity on near-term oil demand prospects will be provided by today’s release of the IEA’s monthly report.

17-Jul-2023 17:52:18,Puneet Mishra <puneet.mishra@hertshtengroup.com>,Fw: PVM Fundamental Report April 13 2023,"There is a smorgasbord of reasons to be sceptical about the sustainability of the latest move higher, which took the price of Brent from $70/bbl on March 20 beyond $87/bbl yesterday. Global economic growth is fragile, inflationary pressure could easily become elevated again and the oil balance is anything but tight if the updated Short-Term Energy Outlook from the EIA is to be relied upon.

Not only did the IMF marked its global real GDP growth for 2023 and 2024 down by 0.1% to 2.8% and 3.0% respectively it also warned of the possibility of hard landing and emphasized the growing risk of financial instability. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the fund warned that inflation proves to be much harder to tackle than previously anticipated. The continuous rise in borrowing costs started to have an impact on the wider economy and on the financial markets as manifested in last year’s turbulence in the UK’s bond market or the recent fallout in the US banking sector. The latest forecasts indicate a 25% chance of global growth tumbling below 2% this year. In case of a significant financial shock, which has a 15% chance to materialize, global growth will plausibly fall below the increase in population resulting in recession. Rising interest rates pose “acute” risks to the global financial system and smaller banks could easily suffer a similar fate to that of the three US financial institutions that collapsed last month. It is a cloudy forecast, indeed.

The shock decision by the OPEC+ group to reduce their output levels by an additional 1.66 mbpd starting from May sent oil prices higher. Whilst it will undoubtedly tighten the oil balance, the head of the International Energy Agency pointed out the medium-term danger of the step, especially the risk it constitutes to global economic expansion. Right on cue, the IMF believes that every 10% rise in the price of oil leads to 0.1% decline in global growth and a 0.3% increase in inflation.

The headwinds the global economy is facing is neatly reflected in the latest EIA projection. The call on OPEC was cut considerably. On an annualized basis demand for the organization’s oil is now set to stand at 27.83 mbpd, 230,000 bpd less than predicted in March. The second half of the year looks disheartening. Global oil demand was reduced by 120,000 bpd whilst non-OPEC supply upped by the same amount. The call on OPEC is now seen at 28.03 mbpd. Curiously, despite last week’s OPEC+ decision to supply significantly less oil to the global market between May and December the EIA has not fully aligned its projection for OPEC output. For 2H 2023 it is now predicted to be 28.16 mbpd, a downward revision of 520,000 bpd when the combined cuts from the four Middle East member countries, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, and the UAE, are forecast to total 983,000 bpd. This reduction, however, is still bigger than the downward revision in OPEC call, consequently, OECD stocks are now seen at 2.869 billion bbls in 3Q and 2.850 billion bbls in 4Q, around 40 million bbls lower than estimated last month but still considerably above the end-2022 level. Because of the downward revision in stockpiles the price forecast for the European crude oil marker has been amended by $2/bbl upward for this year, to $85/bbl, a little bit higher than the year-to-date price combined with the 2023 curve but well below the updated post-OPEC+ forecasts of $90+ and above.

In the face of these adversities oil prices are holding up remarkably well and they are seemingly poised to climb higher, if not in the immediate future, then in the second half of the year. And there is an array of price supportive factors that will potentially overwrite current economic concerns. Firstly, oil demand will jump significantly in 2H 2023. The EIA puts this growth rate just over 1 mbpd, OPEC and the IEA will probably trump it later this week. The year-on-year consumption growth of 710,000 bpd from China is especially re-assuring. Secondly, for those who are data driven it is obvious that recent negative economic data, like the slump in US manufacturing activity or falling demand for labour is actually a blessing in disguise as it shows that monetary tightening is working. Inflation is being reined in whilst the risk of recession, whilst cannot be ruled out, is not imminent. The effective modus operandi of the Fed and its tentative success in the fight against inflation was laid bare yesterday. US headline inflation was 5% last month, down from 6% in February and from 9.1% in June last year. It also came in below forecast although the core figure at 5.6%, which matched expectations was a tad higher than in the previous month. The dollar was sold off and equities strengthened, albeit the wind was taken out of the stock market’s sails after the Fed minutes showed growing concerns amongst FOMC members about the financial stability of the banking sector.

Thirdly, it would seem risky to bet on continuously solid Russian oil production and exports. The country’s output declined 700,0000 bpd in March month-on-month, according to the Energy Ministry, more than the pledged 500,0000 bpd reduction, whilst last week’s seaborne exports broke below 3 mbpd, a weekly decline of 1.24 mbpd, ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg indicates. Despite ominous economic uncertainty, rising demand coupled with OPEC+ cuts are setting the scene for global stock depletion. Although the economic outlook is admittedly ambiguous, and the investment climate can change quickly, all things considered the current medium-term oil price risk is plausibly skewed to the upside.

This view was confirmed by yesterday’s performance. The $1.70/bbl gain in crude oil prices came despite a surprise build in US crude oil stocks. It was the result of a record weekly fall in exports and a congressionally mandated release of crude oil from SPR. Product inventories drew less than projected. Further price supports arrived in the form of a spectacular but not surprising U-turn from the US Energy Secretary, who now expects strategic inventories to be re-filled soon “if it is advantageous to taxpayers”, creating extra oil demand, possibly over the summer months. The political tit-for-tat is in full swing.

17-Jul-2023 17:52:12,Puneet Mishra <puneet.mishra@hertshtengroup.com>,Fw: PVM Fundamental Report April 12 2023,"After plateauing for several days following an OPEC-induced spike, oil prices regained some bullish momentum on Tuesday. Buying pressures were supported by upbeat macro releases out of China. Data showed its annual inflation rate hit an 18-month low last month. Moreover, new bank lending hit an all-time high in the first quarter. Elsewhere, a gauge of investor morale in the eurozone improved this month. Meanwhile, the IMF failed to spoil the risk-on mood despite trimming its growth forecasts. The Washington-based lender expects global growth will bottom out this year at 2.8% before rising to 3% in 2024. Both projections are down 0.1% from its January’s estimates.

Away from the macro front, the EIA released its updated forecasts concerning the oil balance. The US energy agency trimmed its global oil demand growth for this year by 40,000 bpd from last month’s forecast to 1.44 mbpd. All the while, it upgraded the outlook for US crude supply. Domestic production is now seen expanding by 660,000 bpd this year, up from a previous estimate of 560,000 bpd. The upshot of these mildly bearish revisions is that the EIA cut its 2023 Brent price forecast by $2/bbl to $83/bbl.

Staying in the US, data released overnight by the API showed US crude stocks rose by 380,000 bbls. Products were a mixed affair with gasoline inventories increasing by 450,000 bbls and distillate fuel stockpiles shrinking by 2 million bbls. Aside from data concerning oil inventories, market players are also bracing for a decisive inflation report which will have major ramifications for the Fed’s next policy move. Simply put, today is sure to be a heavy US-centric session.

More than a week has passed since oil markets were stumped by the surprise decision from OPEC to cut production. The initial knee-jerk reaction which saw oil prices surge has since given way to calmer conditions thereby providing a timely opportunity to take stock of the current situation. Nearest-term Brent crude futures rallied $6/bbl on the day of the OPEC announcement and have held onto these gains, so far. While the prompt Brent contract is trading around $6/bbl higher than before the OPEC shock, the upswing in prices has been less prominent on longer-dated contracts. Brent futures expiring in December 2023 are trading “only” $4/bbl higher prior to the unexpected OPEC cut. Oddly, the strength witnessed on outright prices has been missing on the prompt timespread. The M1/M2 Brent futures spread is currently printing around 40 cts/bbl, more or less unchanged from 10 days ago.

Arguably, the biggest and unexpected outcome of the OPEC decision to trim production is the muted impact on the gap between light, sweet Brent and medium, sour Dubai crude. The prompt Brent-Dubai EFS initially shrank to $1.40/bbl, its narrowest in more than two years, but swiftly returned to pre-OPEC levels of around $2/bbl. This is surprising given that nearly 1 mbpd of supply from the Middle East will disappear from the market as of next month.

Although low by historical standards, a further narrowing of the Brent-Dubai EFS could have injected some much-needed impetus for producers of Brent-linked crudes. A weakening EFS translates into a fall of Brent’s premium to the Dubai marker and therefore makes it more attractive for Asian buyers to increase their purchases of Brent-denominated crude. Currently, however, Asian refiners are shunning spot cargoes from European and African markets. For instance, just over 30 million barrels of West African crude have been loaded for Asia in March, the smallest volume since 2014 or earlier, according to Reuters.

Asian refiners are embracing sanctioned Russian crude and there is little to suggest they will change tac. After all, Russian oil is still trading at a healthy discount to the Brent marker. Urals delivered to India is pricing around $15/bbl below Dated Brent while Russia’s sweet, light ESPO crude grade is swapping hands for around $10/bbl less than the global benchmark. All the while, Brent-linked crudes such as Nigeria’s Qua Iboe and Forcados crude continue to trade at a premium to Dated Brent.

As things stand, Brent-linked crudes face an uphill battle to regain the interest of Asian refiners. Producers of Brent linked-crude grades, therefore, have good reason to be alarmed at limited export opportunities to the Far East. One way in which Asian-bound cargoes of Brent crude could be revived is if the Brent-Dubai EFS would flip into negative territory. While this may seem unlikely, it would be unwise to rule out the possibility that Dubai crude could move into a premium above Brent in the coming months with the Chinese reopening set to spur demand for Middle Eastern crudes. However improbable, this would greenlight arbitrage opportunities for Atlantic Basin cargoes into Asia. In the meantime, constrained export prospects to key Asian markets coupled with increasing supplies across the Atlantic Basin should limit upside potential on the front end of the Brent structure.

17-Jul-2023 17:52:07,Puneet Mishra <puneet.mishra@hertshtengroup.com>,Fw: PVM Fundamental Report April 11 2023,"The developing upbeat sentiment has not changed over the Easter break, oil prices are holding up reasonably well – notwithstanding yesterday’s retreat. The second consecutive weekly gains were registered in the previous 5-day period and the question now is whether the downtrend, which started in the middle of last year and recently accelerated due to the mini-banking crisis is irrevocably over or the latest developments have raised false hopes. The recovery from the sell-off that took the price of Brent to $70/bbl by the end of March has been the function of ostensible improvements in the economic and therefore in demand outlook and bullish factors on the supply side of the oil equation have also played undisputable role in the ongoing price strength.

Economy/oil demand: the crisis in the US and to a certain extent in the European banking sector that was tiggered by depositors withdrawing their money sent shivers down the spine of investors. The fall-out, however, has proved brief. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank together with the forced marriage of UBS and Credit Suisse do not carry systemic risk, at least this is what the market reaction of the past two weeks implies. Equities recovered impressively from the slump seen in the first half of the previous month although the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index has failed to approach the pre-crisis level after bottoming out on March 23. And this is one of the two major uncertainties that could turn the currently optimistic view on its head. A full-on financial crisis has been avoided but an eventual credit crisis, where borrowing becomes more expensive and less available could embitter the mood once again.

The other known unknown is central banks’ success of their fight against inflation. The general perception is that the rise in consumer and producer prices can be and is being brought under control without seriously harming economic growth. One of the most significant data sets the US Fed is looking at when deciding on interest rate rise is the US job market. The latest figures from last week suggest growing confidence that inflationary pressure is receding. Although job growth was still sturdy in March and the rate of joblessness is hovering around lows not seen in decades demand for workers is slowing. The Bureau of Labour Statistics estimates that the US economy added 236,000 jobs in March, compared to an upwardly revised 326,000 in February and 472,000 in January. Optimism is on the ascent that the Federal Reserve is successfully and effectively slowing down the economy and it will not be forced to speed up the increase in borrowing costs. A hike of 0.25% is anticipated in May. Tomorrow’s inflation data will shed further light on the Fed’s possible thinking going forward – headline inflation rate is expected to have risen 5.2% in March year-on-year whilst the core reading is anticipated to show a rise of 5.6%.

We shall find out soon enough if the current sanguine climate on the economic front permeates the oil market. The updated reports on the global oil balance will be published this week; The EIA is the first one to release its findings today followed by OPEC on Thursday and the IEA on Friday. It must be re-iterated that the second half of the year is set to see a considerable jump in global (and Chinese) oil consumption. In fact, oil demand is to reach hitherto unscaled peaks in the latter part of the year and unchanged or even improved estimates will go a long way to provide the next sign of encouragement for those with bullish inclinations.

Supply: the decision from the OPEC+ group to reduce output levels by 1.6 mbpd from May till the end of the year had the market shell-shocked and the natural reaction was a jump of $6/bbl in oil prices. According to the official narrative, the cut is “a precautionary measure aimed at supporting the stability of the oil market”, its timing, however, is precarious and perplexing. It came just days after the US announced that its depleted strategic reserves will not be re-filled in the foreseeable futures contrary to earlier pledges, effectively removing around 1 mbpd of demand off the market this year. One cannot help but think that apart from the obvious, ie. defending the price floor of around $80/bbl, the decision has had a political angle.

Whatever the reason for the unexpected move it will make the oil balance considerably tighter. If that is the case, then why has the oil market not been able to follow through the rally from last Monday? The most plausible explanation is that the fear of oil getting dearer will accelerate the increase in consumer and producer prices just when inflation is seemingly tackled and this, in turn, will lead to protracted and steeper rise in interest rates. Simply put, the odds of a recession have increased. It is not to say that there will be recession but a rally in oil prices will certainly act as a break on economic expansion, the thinking goes.

Will it happen? It is impossible to know. The current snapshot indicates stronger prices for the rest of the year. The spirited mood is reflected in the latest CFTC report in WTI’s net speculative length. Money managers have quadrupled the amount of money invested in WTI futures and options over the past two weeks (doubled it last week) and tripled their net length in the US benchmark. The combination of the short-lived banking crisis and the OPEC+ move to shore up oil prices have done the trick for now. Currently available data - the Fed’s dot plot, a barometer of future rate increases and the supply-demand balance- foretells tamed inflation and thinning global oil inventories. These pillars of oil price support, however, are standing on wobbly legs. Financial and oil data and even the tone of rhetoric between world powers and between producer and consumer nations will grow in significance as the year progresses. And a hint of rising inflation or loosening oil balance will sour the mood as quickly as it brightened it in the past two weeks. The corner is being turned but the task has not been completed.

17-Jul-2023 17:51:59,Puneet Mishra <puneet.mishra@hertshtengroup.com>,Fw: PVM Fundamental Report April 06 2023,"Positive oil fundamentals are playing second fiddle to macro concerns. That was the key takeaway from yesterday’s price action. The oil market failed to extend its post-OPEC gains on Wednesday as investors digested weaker-than-expected economic reports. A business survey suggested the economic recovery in the eurozone gathered pace last month, albeit at a slower pace than previously thought. The S&P Global’s composite PMI climbed to a 10-month high of 53.7 in March from 52 in February but undershot the preliminary reading of 54.1.

Meanwhile, growth in the US services sector unexpectedly slowed sharply in March. The Institute of Supply Management’s purchasing managers’ index fell to 51.2 from 55.1. In a further negative development, payroll processor ADP said private businesses in the US created 145,000 jobs in March, below forecasts of 200,000. The downbeat report came on the heels of data released on Tuesday showing job openings in the US fell in February to the lowest level in nearly two years. This suggests that the US labour market is losing momentum.

Amid the flurry of bearish macro updates was a bullish stock report from the EIA pointing to draws across the board. US crude stocks fell by 3.7 million bbls last week, beating expectations for a 2.3 million bbl drop. The bulk of the draw took place on the US Gulf Coast amid strong export demand. Crude shipments rose to 5.2 mbpd, the second highest on record. Over the past four weeks, US crude exports averaged 4.94 mbpd, 1.6 mbpd more than during the same period in 2022. All the while, product stocks also drew sharply on the back of rising domestic demand. Gasoline stockpiles plunged by a forecast-beating 4.1 million bbls while distillate fuel inventories shrunk by 3.6 million bbls. Ultimately, this price-supportive report had a muted impact on sentiment. The oil market’s bullish momentum may have paused but upside potential remains given the tightening supply backdrop.

There was no shortage of negative reactions to OPEC’s latest move to encourage higher stable oil prices. The announcement that it will cut production by over 1 mbpd next month until the end of the year was greeted with widespread shock. This is despite it being consistent with the group’s new policy of acting pre-emptively. Indeed, this is not the first time that OPEC+ has been berated for its unexpected decision-making. Last October, the producer group was widely chastised for cutting output by 2 mbpd and squeezing supplies in a tight market. OPEC was ostensibly responding to rising interest rates in the West and a weak global economy. And sure enough, its pre-emptive decision turned out to be well-judged.

At the time China’s economy was reeling from Covid restrictions while high inflation readings and rising interest rates were crimping demand in major Western economies. The upshot is that global oil demand fell in the final quarter of 2022 on annual basis for the first time since 2020.

Going into this year, the stage was set for a strong opening in the world’s biggest crude importer after the lifting of draconian Covid measures. Energy forecasters rushed to upgrade their global oil demand forecasts to reflect the looming rebound in China. However, global oil demand growth started 2023 with a whimper as China’s oil demand bounce failed to materialise. Chinese crude buying was weak in January and February. What’s more, China’s economic resurgence is still elusive. PMI surveys for March showed China’s non-manufacturing sector activity expanded at the fastest rate in more than a decade in March but manufacturing growth lost momentum from the previous month. This uneven showing suggests the foundations for China’s recovery are far from solid. Needless to say, this poses a downside risk to domestic oil demand.

Chinese demand optimism is fading following a downbeat start to the recovery, a fact that weighed heavily on the minds of OPEC’s leadership. In their view, the absence of hard data on Chinese buying was more than good reason to tighten the oil spigots. In other words, the cartel’s cut is a sign that the demand side of the oil equation is not as strong as it seems.

That is not to say that Chinese oil demand is in the doldrums. The country’s fuel consumption will pick up steam over the coming months in line with the post-pandemic recovery. Moreover, crude import demand will be supported by the opening of new refinery capacity. China will still account for the bulk of this year’s oil demand recovery, albeit, perhaps crucially, by less than previously thought. Better said, China’s oil demand over the coming months could surprise to the downside, especially if oil prices come within striking distance of triple digits.

Only time will tell if OPEC’s demand concerns are justified. In the meantime, the timeline for a drawdown in global oil stocks has been brought forward. Before OPEC’s latest cuts, implied balances from the IEA showed +300,000 bpd in 2Q, -1.1 mbpd in 3Q and -1.7 mbpd in 4Q. Now, though, the oil market is set to shift to a deficit in the current quarter and will likely over-tighten in the second half of the year with prices overshooting by the year-end.

17-Jul-2023 17:51:50,Puneet Mishra <puneet.mishra@hertshtengroup.com>,Fw: PVM Fundamental Report April 05 2023,"After the weekend’s OPEC+ announcement some kind of calm has been restored in our market. Or it is better to say that whilst the price supportive impact of the seismic cut from the producer group will unreservedly tighten the oil balance in May and beyond focus shifted to the here and now yesterday. And the present raises concerns about healthy economic expansion as Chinese, euro zone and US manufacturing activity slowed last month. If you add to that record Russian diesel flows to the Middle East last month, as reported by Reuters based on ship-tracking data from several sources, the sluggish performance of the ICE Gasoil and the CME Heating Oil contracts will not come as a surprise. Middle distillates acted as a brake on any attempt to push crude oil prices meaningfully higher. Overnight support, however, came from the API, which reported hefty draws across the board.

The dilemma is whether gloomy economic prospects or the 1.7 mbpd cut in OPEC+ output will dominate investors’ thinking. It is not a far-fetched thought to conclude that the immediate upside potential is limited since the initial reaction to the OPEC+ announcement has pushed prices higher, the surprise move has been baked into the prices and now the next bullish impetus will come when these cuts are actually implemented.

Until then, the market could easily see-saw, but no major meltdown is anticipated. The latest set of manufacturing data was somewhat disheartening but the banking crisis, which pushed equities and oil significantly lower last month does not seem to pose systemic risk. Short- sellers are unlikely to initiate action, especially that the structures of the two major crude oil futures contracts are firmly backwardated with Brent CFDs also strengthening of late. A protracted fall below the $80/bbl mark seems implausible after the announced cuts from the alliance but breaking above $90/bbl will take time.

As frequently underlined on the pages of this report the past year has been nothing short of unprecedented in global politics, economy and in the oil market. Russia’s territorial ambitions are dividing the world more than any time after the Cold War ended in 1990, inflation is high and taming it is a strenuous challenge for central banks, and as the weekend’s developments explicitly exposed, producers and consumers view today’s world through entirely different lenses. Under the current ambiguous circumstances where unpredictability rules central intervention in the market’s functioning is as good as inevitable. Strategic stocks are released, not because there is an emergency or shortage of oil but due to galloping prices, natural gas consumption is centrally influenced, oil companies’ excess profit is taxed, price ceilings are set, and traditional oil flows are re-directed. It is far from being the ideal world one would hope for. The latest example of the growing dominance of the law of the jungle comes from one, if not the most, liberal states of the US, California.

The Democratic Governor of the most populous US state, Gavin Newsom signed a bill last week, which, effective June 26, empowers the California Energy Commission to set a ceiling for refiners on gross gasoline margins and to impose financial penalties on companies that exceed it. The move comes despite retail gasoline prices falling. Premium reformulated gasoline prices in California, for example, are considerably below the peak of $6.6/gallon seen in the middle of June last year. The latest EIA data shows that motorists on the west coast of the US had to fork out $5 for a gallon for this type of motor fuel.

The reason for the political intervention is high refining margins, gasoline’s relative strength over its feedstock, crude oil. The state’s energy commission puts the value of the crack spread of branded fuel at $1.37/gallon for the week ending March 27, which is considerably higher than the 59 cents/gallon refinery profit recorded in the first half of December last year but half as much as the $2.77/gallon peak seen last year although nearly 40% more expensive than the seasonal 5-year average.

The bill is a watered-down version of the original intention of the governor who raised the possibility of introducing a windfall tax on the oil industry at the time when retail prices shot above $6/gallon “that would go directly back to California taxpayers”. His plan then had to be altered because it found insurmountable hurdles in the Legislature. The legislation, instead, will focus on transparency and will require the industry to provide information on maintenance and pricing so potential gouging of consumers becomes as conspicuous as possible. The bill eventually went through due to the Democratic majority in the California State Senate although support from the donkeys was anything but unanimous and overwhelming.

The pertinent question is whether the original objective of reducing pump prices will be achieved. The proponents of the legislation argue that the requirements to disclose information about pricing will deter price gouging. They would also assert that the power mandated to the California Energy Commission to impose profit penalties will encourage companies to keep prices low. Under the bill setting penalties is prohibited if it has an adverse impact on retail prices.

The antagonists disagree. The Western States Petroleum Association says that the state’s policies to limit gasoline production is to blame for the occasional price spikes. The potentially negative consequences of the commission’s ability to impose penalties cannot be ignored either. The additional requirements and profit limits could simply divert companies elsewhere reducing supplies and consequently driving costs and prices higher. The biggest US gasoline market is reliant on a handful of refiners and on imports, predominantly from Asia but also from Europe because it is cut off by the Rocky Mountains from major US refining centres, consequently the law will do nothing to ensure growing supply and could easily prove counter-productive, the reasoning goes.

17-Jul-2023 17:51:43,Puneet Mishra <puneet.mishra@hertshtengroup.com>,Fw: PVM Fundamental Report April 04 2023,"War begets war. Every major political, financial or energy event and development over the past year is the direct or indirect consequence of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The expansion of NATO, growing tension between China and the US, central banks’ perpetual hike of borrowing costs and the sometimes-irrational actions of oil consumers and producers would have not taken place without Russia’s territorial ambitions. It has been a dog-eat-dog world where short-term interest of global actors is the sole objective. There is a complete lack of common purpose in world politics and the enlightened self-interest, which ensures mutually beneficial prosperity in the medium-to long-term is conspicuously AWOL from the global economy. The weekend’s decision from the central banker of the oil world perfectly fits this trend. The energy war intensifies.

There are several possible and implausible explanations as why the producer group decided to shock the oil and financial markets and cut output level by more than 1 mbpd starting May until the end of 2023. (Remember, at the end of last week several OPEC sources suggested no change in output policy.) Unquestionably, it was a co-ordinated move, the timing of which is curious, to say the least. Sunday’s decision, which takes the total reduction in the group’s output level above 3.5 mbpd is a team effort: Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE, Kuwait, Algeria, Gabon, Oman, Kazakhstan, and Russia have all pledged to reduce their respective production levels. The announcement came just one day prior to the group’s JMMC meeting where an actual production cut of 1.66 mbpd was declared, deeper than what the initial calculations implied. The market was not able to react immediately therefore it does not come as a surprise that oil prices opened nearly $6/bbl higher on Sunday evening.

And the casus belli? Maybe the most convenient explanation is that $80/bbl is the pain threshold for the alliance basis Brent – it must be defended. Increasing the supply cushion for real emergency can also be an ace up in the sleeve. Another reason could be economic concerns. The move might have been a pre-emptive strike as the recent banking crisis will inevitably hinder economic growth and consequently oil demand is going to suffer. Last week’s stock market performance and the rally in oil prices, however, go in the face of this argument. We must also not forget the prevailing tension between one of the world’s largest oil producers, OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia and the biggest demand centre, the US. The US administration has been putting pressure on OPEC to increase production and some lawmakers have even threatened with the re-introduction of the NOPEC bill, under which the sovereign immunity of OPEC members would be revoked, and member countries and their national oil companies could face lawsuits for violating the US antitrust law.

The potential impact of the move can be far-reaching. Simply put, the oil balance is expected to tighten considerably if the cuts were fully implemented. OPEC’s research team predicted a demand for its crude oil to stand at 28.62 mbpd for 2Q and 29.81 mbpd for 2H 2023. A reduction of 1.6 mbpd from the combined output level would turn the projected surplus of 880,000 bpd for the incumbent quarter into a deficit around 800,000 bpd. Perhaps more importantly, the second half of the year would look awfully bullish. Adjusting the OPEC+ output level to the new quotas global oil inventories would fall nearly 2 mbpd in the latter six months of 2023, 1.62 mbpd in 3Q and 2.20 mpbd in 4Q. These figures are clearly price supportive.

Of course, it is an entirely different question what action the producer group would take if prices rallied towards the $100/bbl mark. Although the new quota levels are expected to remain in effect until the end of the year they are not set in stone and could easily and swiftly be amended should developments warrant it. And there is a good chance that OPEC+ would start increasing production in case of a protracted rise in oil prices. The second question is how central banks will react. It is a nightmare scenario they are facing. A prolonged increase in oil price will undoubtedly hasten the rise in consumer prices. The main reason behind moderating inflationary pressure has been the fall in energy prices. On the other hand, central banks pay more attention to core than headline inflation figures and might not be inclined to deviate from the current course of action, ie, raising borrowing costs faster than planned.

Last but not least, it will be intriguing to see if Russia lives up to expectations. The country volunteered to cut production by 500,000 bpd in March and this reduction will now be extended until the end of the year. However, latest data suggests that its oil output remained resilient throughout last month and its actions might not match its words going forward. Notwithstanding its need for every petrodollar it can get its hand on it might actually be forced to reduce output if or when the price of its crude oil and products jumps above the level set as the ceiling by the G7 countries.

The situation is fluid and there is a lot to ponder but yesterday’s price action was straightforward – shorts covered. Although Iraq is close to an agreement with the Kurdish Regional Government to restart oil exports, the manufacturing sectors in China, the euro zone and the US performed less than splendidly in March, equities retreated, focus was firmly and understandably on the OPEC+ move. The two major crude oil contracts gained around $5/bbl on the day and the oil balance is now set to tighten meaningfully in coming months. The news is now in the market, it is being digested, a slowdown and even a halt in the rally cannot be ruled out but Brent should not break below $80/bbl. The next bullish impetus will come when the advertised cuts are reassuringly implemented but a prolonged jump over $100/bbl might be a tall order. The most worrying aspect of the production cut is that it seems part of a politically motivated tit-for-that without the slightest hint of a consensus on supply-demand equilibrium and therefore the rift between the world’s biggest producer and consumer is bound to deepen with unpredictable reverberations. To use last year’s most popular cliché: volatility is all but guaranteed.

17-Jul-2023 17:51:37,Puneet Mishra <puneet.mishra@hertshtengroup.com>,Fw: PVM Fundamental Report April 03 2023,"The first quarter of the year is now behind us, so it is time to attempt drawing a conclusion how investors view the world through the prism of Russia’s protracted invasion of Ukraine with all its consequences on geopolitics, economy and, of course, oil. More than a year has passed since the full-scale invasion started and the initial concerns of the widening of the conflict together with economic malaise and unbearable shortage of oil have been replaced with pragmatism. The fault lines between world powers aspiring for global domination are becoming ever more conspicuous, the world economy is proving somewhat resilient as inflation (more headline than core) is being kept under control (US February PCE has cooled) and consequently oil demand is holding up well. Yet, uncertainties provide a volatile and sometimes violent backdrop, something that is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. The latest example of this unpredictability is yesterday’s shock OPEC+ decision to reduce crude oil production by more than 1 mbpd from next month till the end of the year. We shall have a deeper look at the potential consequences of the move in tomorrow’s note.

Did Russia achieve its target? Far from it. What was hoped to be blitzkrieg has been turned into a trench warfare. Ukraine, with political, economic, and military help from the united west, has been successfully weathering Russian attacks and is planning to launch a counter-offensive. Putin’s declared targets, and there have been quite a few from demilitarizing and de-nazifying Ukraine to protect Russian minorities in the eastern part of the country and in the Crimea and to prevent NATO from expanding have not been achieved and in case of NATO it has actually backfired. Because of the conflict Finland and Sweden decided to join the military alliance. Finland’s application will be approved imminently as Turkey lifted its objection last week and Sweden should follow suit shortly. NATO are expanding.

The inevitable consequence of the western isolation of Russia has been a seemingly stronger relationship with former and recent allies, chiefly China (and Turkey, Iran and even Saudi Arabia). The world’s most populous country saw an unmissable opportunity to strengthen its influence on the world stage by refusing to condemn the Russian war and cement its ties with the invader. An obvious sign of the strong relationship between Russia and China is President Xi’s recent visit to Moscow. This friendship, however, is more of a convenient and practical relationship for Beijing rather than honest affinity. Firstly, only a weak Russia is a useful ally for China and secondly China’s adversaries are still major export markets and will likely remain so for decades to come (admittedly, the opposite is also true) therefore China can ill afford to rock the geopolitical boat more than it has done.

The longer the conflict drags on the less probable Russia’s victory becomes. It is increasingly plausible that not only the recently occupied territories but also Crimea will be re-occupied although the timeline is obscure. It is believed that the use of nuclear weapons by Russia is an impenetrable red line for its allies. It is simply impossible to come up with a scenario where a seriously demotivated and under equipped Russian army could achieve the original target, whatever that might be.

Post-pandemic recovery and Russia’s unprovoked invasion have led to severe inflationary pressure and the era of cheap money came to an abrupt end. Central banks started to raise interest rates with the declared aim of reining in inflation. The jury is still out whether they would be successful in their attempt, but stock markets imply that inflation is peaking, and recession is not anticipated. Equities have been on a roller-coaster ride in the first quarter of the year but ultimately finished the period convincingly higher. The MSCI All-country Index returned 7% in 1Q, and the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 17%. The two major turbulences in the past three months were the January US nonfarm payroll data and last month’s banking crisis. US employers added three times as much jobs as anticipated and the red-hot labour market is a genuine headache for monetary policy makers who are worried about the wage-price spiral risk. In a way, the bank collapse in the US and UBS’s purchase of Credit Suisse, the troubled Swiss lender are almost the unavoidable by-products of the hikes in borrowing costs, however, the risk of financial stability crisis does not seem systemic (although the risk of a credit crisis must not be completely ruled out). The other inevitable effect of monetary tightening is sluggish growth. The IMF expects global expansion to be below 3% this year. The multilateral lender sees the global economy to grow 2.9% this year before expanding 3.1% in 2024.

The salient part of the demand side of the oil equation is Chinese consumption as the country has lifted Covid-related restrictions earlier this year. On the supply side, the pertinent issue is Russia’s oil production and exports in the light of crude oil (December 5) and product (February 5) export bans and price caps implemented by the EU and the G7. As last week’s Chinese manufacturing and service sector data suggested the country’s economy is slowly shifting up a gear or two, but the real deal will come in the second half of the year. According to updated IEA data Chinese consumption will rise from 15.5 mbpd in 1H to 16.4 mbpd in 2H with global demand averaging 103.3 mbpd in the latter part of the year, the highest ever reading. Russian oil production and exports, both crude oil and products, are unexpectedly resilient considering the recent boycotts. It is one of the reasons why 1H oil balance is seen as loose. It is, nevertheless, noteworthy that Russia announced a reduction of 500,000 bpd in its oil output, which is meant to last for several months as part of yesterday’s stunning OPEC+ announcement.

The IEA predicts global oil supply exceeding demand by a combined 900,000 bpd in 1H 2023 assuming an OPEC production level of 29.50 mbpd. No wonder then, that oil prices have lost significant value in the first three months of the year. Demand will improve in 2Q, but stocks should keep building, albeit at a slower pace. The second half of the year, however, ought to see a reversal of this trend as the call on OPEC will jump to 30.80 mbpd. As it was laid bare yesterday, the organization is unlikely, unwilling and unable to ramp up production meaningfully, therefore inventories will decrease. Although calling oil over $100 could prove to be a bold attempt the perceived tight oil balance certainly vindicates higher prices, especially if climbing interest rates will not jeopardize economic prosperity.
